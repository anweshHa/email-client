tailwind css

You are required to build a basic email client using JavaScript (React/Vanilla JS) that allows users to:
View a list of emails.(Email mock api response at the end of the doc)
Read an email's content.
Mark emails as read/unread.
Delete emails.

Requirements:
Inbox View: Display a list of emails with sender name(auto generate using sender email), subject, 3 lines of email content, time and read/unread status.
Read Email: Clicking an email should open its full content. This should update the url to reflect the currently opened email. 
On refresh it should auto show the selected email in url
Mark Read/Unread: Users can mark an email as read/unread from the inbox or email view.
Read/Unread/Selected Status: emails in list  should show a different background color
Delete Email: Users can delete an email from the inbox or email view.
Search: Implement a search/filter function using email title/sender/content.
State Management: Emails updated state should persist within the app state (use local state, Redux, or Context API).
URL update: Update url to mention the currently viewed Emails unique ID, this should be used on refresh to display the correct email

Bonus Features(Optional):
Add categories (Inbox, Trash).
Allow undo on email deletion.
Store state of read/unread/deletion in local storage

this is the given code, in the machine coding round I might be asked to add some features, 
which might include implementing a polyfill or custom hook.
suggest some of those features to me so that I can practice them beforehand.


FE system design interview with anmol
is joining Flipkart as UI-3 right now is good for my career. is this 
ask about behavioural questions
===========================================================================================================================================================

I want to create a email layout, page should have 2 sections, 
35% width should be occupied for listing the emails and 65% should be occupied for viewing a selected email.
keep the code simple and easy to understand and explain.

w-[35%], w-2 (meaning width = 0.5rem), h-2 (meaning height = 0.5rem).
bg-white, bg-gray-50
border-gray-200
text-sm, text-xl, text-gray-600, font-semibold, font-medium, font-bold
gap-2, px-4 py-2, p-6
the h-screen class in Tailwind CSS allows an element to occupy the full height of the viewport. 
The border-r class specifically targets and adds a border to the right side of an element. 
The border-b class specifically targets and adds a border to the bottom edge of an element. 
The border class adds a border to all four sides of an element. 
Class				Behavior
overflow-y-auto			Scrollbar only when needed (on overflow).
overflow-y-scroll		Always show scrollbar, even if not needed.
overflow-y-hidden		Hide overflow; no scrollbar, content clipped.
overflow-y-visible		Content overflows without scroll/clipping.
flex flex-col
flex-1 is a shorthand for flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%.
flex	Parent container	Enables Flexbox layout for children
flex-1	Child element		Makes the element grow and fill available space in a flex container
In Tailwind CSS, mb-2 stands for:	margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
mt-2
| Class | Value in rem | Pixels (approx) |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------- |
| `0`   | `0rem`       | `0px`           |
| `1`   | `0.25rem`    | `4px`           |
| `2`   | `0.5rem`     | `8px`           |
| `3`   | `0.75rem`    | `12px`          |
| `4`   | `1rem`       | `16px`          |
justify-between same as justify-content: space-between;
items-center same as align-items: center;
items-start
rounded gives same effect as border-radius.
rounded-full gives Completely rounded corners, creating a circle or pill shape. 
hover:bg-blue-600
the class **transition-colors** tells the browser that If any color-related property (like color, background-color, etc.) changes, 
	animate the change smoothly.
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white transition-colors px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Hover Me
</button>
On hover, background changes from blue-500 to blue-700. Because of transition-colors, the change is animated smoothly, not instant.
truncate in tailwind css is same as...
	overflow: hidden → hides text that overflows the element.
	text-overflow: ellipsis → adds … to indicate overflow.
	white-space: nowrap → prevents text from wrapping to the next line.
If you want to truncate after multiple lines, use line-clamp-{n} instead.
<p class="line-clamp-2">
  This paragraph will be truncated after 2 lines.
</p>
cursor-pointer
| Class             | Line Height Value | Use Case                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| `leading-none`    | `1`               | No spacing, tightest       |
| `leading-tight`   | `1.25`            | Tight text blocks          |
| `leading-snug`    | `1.375`           | Slightly tight             |
| `leading-normal`  | `1.5`             | Default spacing            |
| `leading-relaxed` | `1.625`           | Comfortable paragraph text |
| `leading-loose`   | `2`               | Very spacious lines        |

the delete button is coming at the very last line, i want it in the next line right after the email content.
that means i guess the height of the email content section should be only that much what is occupied by the email content.
modify the code only for this.

const filteredEmails = useMemo(() => getFilteredEmails(), [activeEmailType, emails]);
what is the difference between doing above and doing below? do we get any advantage when we use one over the other?
const [filteredEmails, setFilteredEmails] = useState<Email[]>(getFilteredEmails());
        useEffect(() => {
          setFilteredEmails(getFilteredEmails());
        }, [activeEmailType, emails]);

bulk delete or mark read, infinite scroll, pagination
url update on search, highlight matched text in list, do not remove search result as long as in same url
